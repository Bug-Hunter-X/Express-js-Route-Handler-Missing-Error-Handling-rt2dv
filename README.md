# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, which attempts to parse a user ID as an integer without any error handling. This can lead to unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior if the ID is not a valid number.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with added error handling to gracefully manage invalid input and prevent crashes.
